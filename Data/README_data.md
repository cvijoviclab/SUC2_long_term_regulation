# About 

This directory contains the data files that make out the foundation of all analysis in the project. Note that each data file should be in a **read only** format. **Note**, upon cloning the project the data (description below) is not in this directory, but it can be retrieved from [ADD]. 

## Data files 

This directory contains two files; **Suc2_0d1Glc_1.csv** and **Suc2_0d1Glc_2.csv**. These files contain single cell YFP-intensity values measured at, in the interval 0 to 480 minutes, every fifth minute for each cell. In addition, for each cell the size and the x and y position in the original image is recorded. In the data sets the external glucose concentration was reduced from 4 % to 0.1 % at time zero. The YFP-measured was controlled by the *SUC2*-promoter, hence these files contain single-cell time-lapse data of the *SUC2*-expression upon long term glucose starvation. The data was collected using a microfluidics device. It should be noted that both data files are experimentally identical. For more details see the paper. 

It should be noted that the two data files are processed versions of the original microscopy images. The original images yielding the csv-files can also be found at [ADD].
